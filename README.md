# 1. Introduction

In this project, I analyze data related to **retail sales and supply chain management**. The goal of the analysis is to understand:
- **Sales trends** and revenue growth over time.
- **Customer behavior** and market segmentation.

The source data originates from the standard **TPC-H dataset** (`snowflake_sample_data.tpch_sf10`), available within the Snowflake environment. The dataset simulates a global business system and consists of the following main tables:

- `ORDERS` – Order headers (who ordered, when, and with what priority).
- `LINEITEM` – Detailed order items (specific products, quantities, prices, discounts, and taxes). This is the primary transactional table.
- `CUSTOMER` – Information about customers and their market segments.
- `SUPPLIER` – Data regarding product suppliers.
- `PART` – A catalog of products and their attributes (manufacturer, brand, size).
- `NATION / REGION` – Geographic reference tables for customers and suppliers.
